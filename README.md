<h1> Portfolio Project </h1>

Check out the portfolio project : https://jaydip-parmar-portfolio.herokuapp.com/

I used React, Redux, MongoDB, NodeJs, Express, and Three.js to create my portfolio project.
There is a home page, about page, projects page, contact page, and an admin page in this project.
I display a Timeline of the projects and my skills on the home page, and you can examine my projects by clicking the "view work" button.
Anyone can contact me using the contact page, and whatever written in the message it will appear in my mail. For that, I used nodemailer.

Only admin can login on the admin page, and I used jwt authentication to create a token.
I can update my skills on the main page by using the admin page. I uploaded my image through cloudinary.I can add or delete timelines, projects, and modify about page from the admin page.
